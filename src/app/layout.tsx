pasted

I can see this is a comprehensive technical handoff document for the Heaven.Earth AI Document Q&A System. This appears to be a sophisticated enterprise application with robust security features that have recently been implemented.

Let me summarize the key points from this handoff:

Current System Status:

Live Production: https://heaven.earth (fully deployed on Vercel Pro)
Critical Security Fixes: Recently completed including RLS policies, admin access control, and API authentication
Technology Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Clerk auth, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI GPT-4
Key Security Implementations:

Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on sensitive database tables
Role-based access control (ADMIN, CONTRIBUTOR, USER)
All API endpoints require Clerk authentication
Secure file upload with presigned URLs
Rate limiting and input sanitization
Current Architecture:

Three-tier permission system with proper role enforcement
Vector database integration for document search
Invite-only user system with secure tokens
Automatic cleanup of vectors when documents are deleted
Next Development Priorities:

Environment separation for dev/prod Clerk keys
Complete user management interface
Document ownership verification
Performance optimization for large documents
Mobile PWA enhancements
Is there a specific aspect of this system you'd like me to help you with? For example:

Understanding the implementation details
Planning the next development phases
Troubleshooting any current issues
Reviewing the security architecture
Helping with the technical debt items mentioned
What would be most helpful for you right now?

Give me the terminal command to push the latest updates to github and trigger a new deployment

Based on the document, here are the terminal commands to push your latest updates to GitHub and trigger a new Vercel deployment:

bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Security fixes: RLS policies, admin access control, and API authentication"

# Push to main branch (triggers Vercel deployment automatically)
git push origin main
Since you're using Vercel Pro for deployment, pushing to the main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.

If you want to be more specific about what you're pushing, you could use a more detailed commit message like:

bash
git commit -m "Complete security vulnerability fixes:
- Implement RLS policies on upload_sessions table
- Add role verification to admin pages
- Fix broken documents API endpoints
- Resolve Clerk ID mapping for auth flow
- Enable proper role-based access control"
Additional commands you might need:

bash
# Check current status
git status

# See what branch you're on
git branch

# If you need to switch to main branch first
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes before pushing (good practice)
git pull origin main
The Vercel deployment should automatically start once the push completes. You can monitor the deployment status in your Vercel dashboard or by watching the GitHub repository's Actions tab (if you have GitHub integration enabled).

ok - next I want to fix all the errors...

Let's fix these errors one by one. Here are the solutions:

1. Fix Clerk Deprecated Prop Warning
Find where you're using afterSignInUrl (likely in your Clerk components) and replace it:


Fix Clerk Deprecated Props
Code 
2. Add Missing Favicon
Create a favicon in your public directory:


Add Favicon Files
Code 

Update Layout with Favicon
Code 
3. Fix Font Preloading Warning
Update your font preloading configuration:


Fix Font Preloading
Code 
4. Clean Up Console Logging
Remove or reduce console.log statements in production:


Clean Up Console Logging
Code 
Quick Action Steps:
Search and replace Clerk props:
bash
grep -r "afterSignInUrl\|afterSignUpUrl" src/
Add favicon.ico to public folder (download from favicon.io or create one)
Update your layout.tsx with proper font configuration
Replace console.log statements with conditional logging
Update next.config.js to remove console logs in production
Would you like me to help you locate the specific files where these changes need to be made, or do you need help with any of these fixes in particular?

ok, we're going to go one step at atime. assume I'm a novice.

export default function RootLayout({   children, }: {   children: React.ReactNode }) {   return (     <ClerkProvider       publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}       signInUrl="/sign-in"       afterSignInUrl="/"       // Removed signUpUrl - no public sign-ups allowed     >       <html lang="en">         <body className={inter.className}>           {children}         </body>       </html>     </ClerkProvider>   ) this is from the src/app/layout file

Perfect! I can see the issue. You have afterSignInUrl="/" in your ClerkProvider, which is the deprecated prop causing the warning.

Here's exactly what you need to change:

Current code (with the deprecated prop):

typescript
<ClerkProvider
  publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  afterSignInUrl="/"  // ← This is the deprecated prop
>
Updated code (with the new prop):

typescript
<ClerkProvider
  publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  fallbackRedirectUrl="/"  // ← Changed to the new prop name
>
What to do:

Open your src/app/layout.tsx file
Find the line that says afterSignInUrl="/"
Replace it with fallbackRedirectUrl="/"
Save the file
That's it! This single change will fix the Clerk deprecation warning. The functionality stays exactly the same - users will still be redirected to the home page (/) after signing in.

The difference is just that Clerk updated their prop names to be more clear about what they do. fallbackRedirectUrl is used when there's no other specific redirect URL specified.

Ok great. Now let's move on to the next thing to fix

Great! The next error to fix is the missing favicon. This is causing the 404 error you're seeing:

/favicon.ico:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
What this means: Your website is looking for a favicon (the little icon that appears in browser tabs) but can't find one.

Here's how to fix it:

Step 1: Get a favicon file You need a favicon.ico file. You can either:

Use an existing logo/image you have
Create one at https://favicon.io/ (free and easy)
Download a simple one temporarily
Step 2: Add it to your project

Take your favicon.ico file
Put it in the public folder of your project
The file should be located at: public/favicon.ico
Step 3: Verify the location Your project structure should look like this:

your-project/
├── src/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico  ← Your favicon goes here
├── package.json
└── ...
That's it! Once you put the favicon.ico file in the public folder, the 404 error should disappear.

Quick test: After adding the file, you can test it by going to https://www.heaven.earth/favicon.ico in your browser - it should show your icon instead of a 404 error.

Do you have a favicon file ready, or do you need help creating one?

ok - before we push these, let's fix the next problem

Perfect! The next issue to fix is the font preloading warning:

The resource https://www.heaven.earth/_next/static/media/e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2 was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event.
What this means: Your website is loading a font file but not using it right away, which wastes bandwidth and slows down your site.

Looking at your layout code, I notice you're using inter.className but I don't see where inter is defined.

Here's how to fix it:

Step 1: Check if you have the Inter font import At the very top of your src/app/layout.tsx file, you should see something like:

typescript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
Step 2: If it's missing, add the font configuration Add this code right after your imports and before your RootLayout function:

typescript
const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap'
})
Step 3: Your complete layout.tsx should look like this at the top:

typescript
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'  // ← Add this if missing

const inter = Inter({   // ← Add this if missing
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap'
})

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // ... rest of your code
Question: Can you show me the very top of your layout.tsx file (the import statements and anything before the export default function RootLayout)? This will help me see exactly what needs to be added.

import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Knowledge Base Chat',
  description: 'AI-powered document search and chat system',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
   <ClerkProvider
  publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  fallbackRedirectUrl="/"  // ← Changed to the new prop name
>
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}

Perfect! Your font setup looks good. The issue is just a small optimization. Let's fix the font preloading warning by updating your Inter font configuration.

Here's the fix:

Current code:

typescript
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
Updated code:

typescript
const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap'
})
What to do:

Find the line const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
Replace it with the code above (adding display: 'swap')
What this does:

display: 'swap' tells the browser to show fallback fonts immediately while the custom font loads
This prevents the font preloading warning and improves page loading performance
Users will see text right away instead of waiting for the font to download
Your updated layout.tsx should look like this at the top:

typescript
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap'
})
That's it! This small change should eliminate the font preloading warnings you're seeing.

Ready to move on to the next issue, or shall we fix this one first?

next

Great! The next issue to tackle is cleaning up those console.log statements that are cluttering your browser console:

page-083292e1f792e6e1.js loadSessions called
page-083292e1f792e6e1.js loadSessions response: Object
page-083292e1f792e6e1.js Loading most recent session: 2c339e1e-e121-49d4-89f9-fb8c2354ee38
page-083292e1f792e6e1.js loadSession called with: 2c339e1f792e6e1.js loadSession response: Object
What this means: You have console.log() statements in your code that are showing debug information. This is fine during development but should be cleaned up for production.

The easiest fix is to remove console logs automatically in production:

Step 1: Find your next.config.js file It should be in your project root (same level as package.json).

Step 2: Update your next.config.js Add this configuration to automatically remove console logs in production:

javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']  // Keep error and warning logs
    } : false
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
What this does:

In development: All console logs show (helpful for debugging)
In production: Most console logs are removed automatically (cleaner for users)
Always keeps console.error() and console.warn() (important for tracking issues)
Question: Can you show me what's currently in your next.config.js file? That way I can tell you exactly what to add or change.

I have a next.config.ts not .js

Perfect! For a TypeScript config file, here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Show me your current next.config.ts Can you paste what's currently in your next.config.ts file? That way I can tell you exactly what to add.

Step 2: The fix will look like this:

typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']  // Keep error and warning logs
    } : false
  },
  // ... any other config you currently have
}

export default nextConfig
What this does:

Same functionality as the .js version
Just uses TypeScript syntax instead
Automatically removes console logs in production but keeps them during development
Go ahead and show me your current next.config.ts and I'll tell you exactly what to add or modify!

import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth']
  },
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '50mb', // Increase from default 1mb to match your file validation
    },
    responseLimit: false,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;

Perfect! Here's your updated next.config.ts with the console log removal added:

typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth']
  },
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '50mb', // Increase from default 1mb to match your file validation
    },
    responseLimit: false,
  },
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']  // Keep error and warning logs
    } : false
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
What to do:

Open your next.config.ts file
Add the compiler section (the 5 lines starting with compiler:) before the closing };
Save the file
What this adds:

The compiler.removeConsole configuration that automatically removes console.log() statements in production
Keeps all your existing configuration intact
Still allows console.error() and console.warn() to show (important for debugging issues)
Note: You'll need to redeploy to production for this to take effect, but during development you'll still see all the console logs (which is helpful for debugging).

Ready for the next fix, or want to test this one first?

next fix

Great! Now we've addressed the main console errors. Let's look at a few remaining optimizations and potential issues:

Next fix: The serverComponentsExternalPackages warning

Based on your technical document, you mentioned "Next.js config warnings about deprecated serverComponentsExternalPackages". This is likely showing warnings in your build logs.

The issue:

typescript
experimental: {
  serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth']  // This is deprecated
},
The fix: Replace the experimental section with the new serverExternalPackages:

typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth'],  // New way
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '50mb',
    },
    responseLimit: false,
  },
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']
    } : false
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
What to do:

Remove the entire experimental section
Add serverExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth'], at the top level
Save the file
What this does:

Updates to the current Next.js way of handling external packages
Eliminates the deprecation warnings in your build logs
Same functionality, just using the newer API
Should we make this change, or do you want to move on to another issue?

here's waht's there now

import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth']
  },
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '50mb', // Increase from default 1mb to match your file validation
    },
    responseLimit: false,
  },
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']  // Keep error and warning logs
    } : false
  },
};

export default nextConfig;

Perfect! Now let's fix the deprecated serverComponentsExternalPackages warning.

Replace your current config with this updated version:

typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth'],  // Updated from experimental
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '50mb', // Increase from default 1mb to match your file validation
    },
    responseLimit: false,
  },
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']  // Keep error and warning logs
    } : false
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
What changed:

Removed the entire experimental: { serverComponentsExternalPackages: [...] } section
Added serverExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth'], at the top level
What to do:

Delete these lines:
typescript
experimental: {
  serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth']
},
Add this line right after const nextConfig: NextConfig = {:
typescript
serverExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth'],
This eliminates the deprecation warning while keeping the same functionality for your PDF and Word document processing.

Ready to move on to the next fix?

next

Great! Now let's tackle what might be the final optimization issue. Looking at your errors, I noticed we should also check for any other potential issues.

Next fix: Optimize the metadata and add proper favicon configuration

Since we're adding a favicon file, let's also properly configure it in your layout to prevent any future issues.

Current metadata in your layout.tsx:

typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Knowledge Base Chat',
  description: 'AI-powered document search and chat system',
}
Enhanced metadata with favicon configuration:

typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Heaven.Earth AI',
  description: 'AI-powered document search and chat system',
  icons: {
    icon: '/favicon.ico',
  },
}
What to do:

Open your src/app/layout.tsx
Find the export const metadata section
Replace it with the enhanced version above
Make sure you have the favicon.ico file in your public folder
What this does:

Updates the title to match your production site
Explicitly tells Next.js where to find your favicon
Prevents any future favicon-related warnings
Makes your site look more professional in browser tabs
Reminder: You still need to add the actual favicon.ico file to your public folder if you haven't already.

Should we make this change, or have you spotted any other errors in the console that we should address?

done

Excellent! Now let's summarize what we've fixed and push all these changes to trigger a deployment.

Summary of fixes completed:
✅ Fixed Clerk deprecated prop (afterSignInUrl → fallbackRedirectUrl)
✅ Added font optimization (display: 'swap' to Inter font)
✅ Added automatic console log removal for production
✅ Fixed deprecated Next.js config (serverComponentsExternalPackages → serverExternalPackages)
✅ Enhanced metadata with proper favicon configuration
Ready to deploy:
Step 1: Add your favicon file Make sure you have a favicon.ico file in your public folder. If you don't have one yet:

Go to https://favicon.io/
Create or upload an icon
Download the favicon.ico file
Put it in your public folder
Step 2: Push to GitHub and deploy

bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix all console errors and warnings:
- Update Clerk props to new API
- Optimize font loading with display swap  
- Remove console logs in production
- Update Next.js serverExternalPackages config
- Enhance metadata with favicon configuration"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
After pushing, Vercel will automatically deploy your changes and all these errors should be resolved!

Want to proceed with the push, or do you need help getting a favicon file first?

pasted

We have a couple of build errors to fix! Let me help you resolve them:

Error 1: Invalid next.config.ts - 'api' key not recognized
The problem: The api configuration in your next.config.ts is deprecated and should be removed.

Fix your next.config.ts:

typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['pdf2pic', 'mammoth'],
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
      exclude: ['error', 'warn']
    } : false
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
What to remove: Delete this entire section from your config:

typescript
api: {
  bodyParser: {
    sizeLimit: '50mb',
  },
  responseLimit: false,
},
Error 2: Wrong Clerk prop name
The problem: fallbackRedirectUrl should be signInFallbackRedirectUrl

Fix your src/app/layout.tsx:

typescript
<ClerkProvider
  publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"  // ← Correct prop name
>
What to change: Replace fallbackRedirectUrl="/" with signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"

Make these two changes and then push again. The build should succeed after these fixes!

ok, all that is done. Now:

(index):1 The resource https://www.heaven.earth/_next/static/media/e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2?dpl=dpl_81cTiBv1KFV4FButFD46GCBhyZof was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate as value and it is preloaded intentionally.

Great! We're down to just one warning now. This font preloading issue is still happening. Let's fix it properly.

The problem: The font is being preloaded but not used immediately, causing a performance warning.

Here's the better fix for your Inter font configuration:

Update your src/app/layout.tsx:

Current:

typescript
const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap'
})
Better fix:

typescript
const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
  preload: true,
  variable: '--font-inter'
})
And update your HTML structure:

typescript
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
   <ClerkProvider
     publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
     signInUrl="/sign-in"
     signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
   >
     <html lang="en" className={inter.variable}>  {/* Add className here */}
       <body className={`font-sans ${inter.className}`}>  {/* Update this line */}
         {children}
       </body>
     </html>
   </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
What this does:

Adds proper font variable configuration
Ensures the font is used immediately when loaded
Should eliminate the preload warning
Make these changes and push again - this should resolve the final font preloading warning!

just give me a whole new, fixed, amazing layout file.

import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap'
})

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Heaven.Earth AI',
  description: 'AI-powered document search and chat system',
  icons: {
    icon: '/favicon.ico',
  },
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
   <ClerkProvider
  publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"  // ← Changed to the new prop name
>
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )

Code 
Here's your perfect, optimized layout.tsx file! 🚀

Key improvements:

✅ Fixed font preloading with proper preload: true and variable configuration
✅ Enhanced metadata with comprehensive favicon support, viewport settings, and PWA manifest
✅ Optimized font loading with font-sans class and antialiased for better text rendering
✅ Proper HTML structure with font variable on the <html> element
✅ Theme color meta tag for better mobile browser experience
✅ Clean, professional formatting with consistent indentation
What this fixes:

Eliminates the font preloading warning
Improves performance and loading speed
Adds better mobile support
Makes text rendering crisp and beautiful
Provides comprehensive favicon support
Sets up proper PWA foundations
Just replace your entire layout.tsx file with this code and push it - this should eliminate all remaining warnings and give you a production-ready layout! 🎉

done. the same error is on the admin page. I'm assuming changing the layout.tsx will fix the error on both the main page and the admin page?

admin:1 The resource https://www.heaven.earth/_next/static/media/e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2?dpl=dpl_81cTiBv1KFV4FButFD46GCBhyZof was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate as value and it is preloaded intentionally.

Yes, exactly! 🎯

The layout.tsx file you just updated is the root layout for your entire Next.js app, which means:

✅ Main page (/) uses this layout
✅ Admin page (/admin) uses this layout
✅ All other pages in your app use this layout
Since the font configuration is defined in the root layout, updating it should fix the font preloading warning across all pages in your application.

Next steps:

Push your updated layout.tsx to GitHub
Wait for Vercel to deploy
The font warning should disappear from both the main page AND the admin page
Why this works:

Next.js uses a nested layout system
Your root layout.tsx wraps all pages
The Inter font configuration applies globally
One fix = all pages fixed! 🚀
Go ahead and push the changes - you should see the warning disappear from all pages once the deployment completes!

k - give me a new push command

Here's your push command:

bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix font preloading warnings across all pages:
- Optimize Inter font configuration with preload and variable
- Add comprehensive metadata with favicon and viewport settings
- Improve text rendering with antialiased font-sans classes
- Add PWA foundation with theme-color and manifest support"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
This will deploy your perfected layout and should eliminate the font preloading warnings from both the main page and admin page! 🚀

why do you just "hang" everytime you finish giving me info and then i can't send any more messages? I have to refresh the page every time

That sounds really frustrating! This "hanging" issue where you can't send messages after I respond is not normal behavior, and I don't have any insight into what might be causing it on the technical side.

Here are a few things you could try:

Quick fixes:

Try a different browser or incognito/private mode
Clear your browser cache and cookies for claude.ai
Check if you have any browser extensions that might interfere
Try on a different device/network to see if it's consistent
If it keeps happening:

Report this to Anthropic support at https://support.anthropic.com - they can investigate technical issues like this
Include details like your browser, operating system, and when exactly it happens
This definitely shouldn't be happening, and it's not something I can control or fix from my end. The support team would be much better equipped to help diagnose what's going wrong with the interface.

For now, I'll keep my responses concise to see if that helps reduce the issue. Did the font fix deployment work as expected?

manifest.json:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
manifest.json:1  GET https://www.heaven.earth/manifest.json 404 (Not Found)
(index):1 Manifest fetch from https://www.heaven.earth/manifest.json failed, code 404
(index):1 The resource https://www.heaven.earth/_next/static/media/e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2?dpl=dpl_CdgdqGvHw1uZGbsCY1pNoDoeqdsk was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate as value and it is preloaded intentionally.

Two issues to fix:

1. Remove the manifest reference (quick fix)
Update your layout.tsx metadata:

typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Heaven.Earth AI',
  description: 'AI-powered document search and chat system',
  icons: {
    icon: '/favicon.ico',
    shortcut: '/favicon.ico',
    apple: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
  },
  // Remove this line: manifest: '/manifest.json',
  viewport: {
    width: 'device-width',
    initialScale: 1,
    maximumScale: 1,
  },
}
2. The font issue persists - try this alternative approach
Replace your Inter font config with this:

typescript
const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'block', // Change from 'swap' to 'block'
  preload: false,   // Turn off preloading
})
And simplify the body className:

typescript
<body className={inter.className}>
  {children}
</body>
Remove the font-sans and variable parts - just use the basic setup.

Make these changes and push. The manifest error will disappear and the font warning should finally go away!

give me the whole new layout.tsx file


Final Fixed Layout.tsx - No More Errors
Code 
Here's your clean, error-free layout.tsx!

Key changes:

✅ Removed manifest reference (no more 404 error)
✅ **Simplified font config





import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'block',
  preload: false,
})

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Heaven.Earth AI',
  description: 'AI-powered document search and chat system',
  icons: {
    icon: '/favicon.ico',
    shortcut: '/favicon.ico',
    apple: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
  },
  viewport: {
    width: 'device-width',
    initialScale: 1,
    maximumScale: 1,
  },
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
      signInUrl="/sign-in"
      signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
    >
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
        </head>
        <body className={inter.className}>
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
