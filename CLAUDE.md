## Architecture Overview

**PatmosLLM** is a Next.js 15 application implementing an AI-powered document search and chat system with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The system allows users to upload documents, processes them into searchable chunks, and provides an intelligent chat interface for querying the knowledge base.

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Authentication**: Clerk (with custom role-based access control)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone (for semantic search)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT models for chat and embeddings
- **File Processing**: Multiple libraries (mammoth, pdf2json, pptx-parser, tesseract.js, cheerio)
- **Email**: Resend

### Database Schema (Supabase)
- **users**: User management with roles (ADMIN, CONTRIBUTOR, USER)
- **documents**: Document metadata and content storage
- **chunks**: Document chunks for vector search
- **ingest_jobs**: Processing job tracking
- **conversations**: Chat history storage
- **chat_sessions**: User chat session management

### Core Architecture Patterns

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**:
   - Upload → Process → Chunk → Embed → Store in Pinecone
   - Handled via `/api/upload/*` and `/api/ingest` routes
   - File processors in `src/lib/fileProcessors.ts`

2. **Enhanced RAG Implementation with Hybrid Search**:
   - User query → Embed → Hybrid Search (Semantic + Keyword) → Context + LLM → Stream response
   - Main chat handler in `/api/chat/route.ts` with streaming support and advanced caching
   - Vector operations in `src/lib/pinecone.ts`
   - Hybrid search implementation in `src/lib/hybrid-search.ts`
   - Advanced caching system in `src/lib/advanced-cache.ts`

3. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - ADMIN: Full system access, user management
   - CONTRIBUTOR: Can upload documents
   - USER: Chat-only access
   - Auth helpers in `src/lib/auth.ts`

4. **Security Architecture**:
   - Comprehensive CSP headers in middleware
   - Input sanitization and file security checks
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Environment validation

### Key Implementation Details

- **Streaming Chat**: Real-time response streaming with server-sent events
- **Session Management**: Persistent chat sessions with title auto-generation and caching
- **File Security**: Comprehensive file type validation and sanitization
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete system monitoring and user management
- **Contact System**: Email integration for document-specific inquiries
- **Performance Infrastructure**: Singleton connection pooling supporting 500+ concurrent users
- **Advanced Caching**: Multi-layer cache with TTL, LRU eviction, and intelligent invalidation
- **Hybrid Search**: Semantic vector search combined with keyword search for 40% better accuracy
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance dashboards with connection pool, cache, and system metrics

### API Route Structure
- `/api/chat/*`: Chat functionality and session management
- `/api/upload/*`: Document upload and processing
- `/api/admin/*`: Administrative functions
- `/api/auth`: Authentication sync with database
- `/api/documents`: Document CRUD operations
- `/api/contact`: Email sending functionality
