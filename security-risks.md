## üö® CRITICAL Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Rate Limiting Broken in Serverless
**Status**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Production-breaking, potential DDoS vulnerability
**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours

**Problem**: In-memory `Map()` doesn't persist across serverless function invocations
- Current implementation: `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` uses in-memory storage
- Serverless architecture: Each request may hit a different lambda instance
- Result: Rate limits reset per instance, ineffective protection

**Solution Ready**: Upstash packages installed (`@upstash/ratelimit`, `@upstash/redis`)
- Need to implement distributed rate limiting using Upstash Redis
- Replace in-memory Map with Redis-backed storage
- Configure rate limit windows and thresholds in environment variables

**Next Steps**:
1. Set up Upstash Redis instance (free tier available)
2. Add `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to environment variables
3. Refactor `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` to use Upstash client
4. Test with multiple concurrent requests across different lambda instances

### 2. Supabase Security: Mutable search_path
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Date Fixed**: October 2024

**Problem**: 18 Supabase functions had mutable `search_path` parameter (SQL injection risk)

**Solution Applied**: Set `search_path = ''` for all affected functions via `scripts/fix-supabase-linter-warnings.sql`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Dependency Vulnerabilities (Accepted Risk)

### pptx-parser@1.1.7-beta.9
**Status**: Accepted (low risk)
**Last Reviewed**: October 2024
**NPM Audit Level**: 9 moderate vulnerabilities

**Vulnerabilities**:
- **jszip@2.6.1**: Prototype Pollution, Path Traversal
- **postcss@7.0.39**: Line return parsing error

**Risk Assessment: LOW**

**Justification**:
1. **Limited Usage**: Only used during authenticated document upload (`src/lib/parsers/office/pptx-parser.ts:9`)
2. **Access Control**: Only ADMIN/CONTRIBUTOR roles can upload documents
3. **Not Public-Facing**: Not exposed to untrusted input
4. **Safe Production Versions**: Main app uses jszip@3.10.1, postcss@8.5.6
5. **Package Status**: Last updated May 2022 (unmaintained)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Upload limited to authenticated, trusted users only
- File type validation enforced before processing
- Sentry monitoring for unexpected errors
- Regular security audit reviews

**Future Action**: Consider replacing pptx-parser with maintained alternative when resources allow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Improvements Needed

### 3. No Query Timeouts
**Impact**: Long-running queries could hang, potential DoS
**Priority**: Medium

**Problem**: Database queries have no timeout configured
- Could lead to resource exhaustion
- No protection against slow query attacks

**Solution**:
- Add `statement_timeout` to Supabase connection config
- Implement query timeout middleware
- Add query performance monitoring

### 4. No APM Monitoring
**Impact**: Limited visibility into security incidents
**Priority**: Medium

**Problem**: Only Sentry error tracking, no application performance monitoring
- Can't identify slow endpoints that might indicate attacks
- No visibility into unusual traffic patterns
- Limited forensics capabilities

**Solution**:
- Implement custom APM middleware
- Consider DataDog, New Relic, or similar
- Track request patterns, response times, error rates by endpoint

### 5. No Automated Dependency Scanning
**Impact**: Undetected vulnerabilities in dependencies
**Priority**: Medium

**Problem**: Security vulnerabilities only tracked via manual `npm audit`
- No automated scanning in CI/CD
- Delayed detection of new vulnerabilities
- No alerts on critical security issues

**Solution**:
- Add Dependabot or Snyk to GitHub repo
- Configure automated security alerts
- Integrate dependency scanning into CI/CD pipeline
- Set up Slack/email notifications for critical vulnerabilities

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed Security Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials (FIXED - October 2024)
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Fix**: Moved to `RATE_LIMIT_EXEMPT_USERS` environment variable

### 2. Auth Race Condition (FIXED - October 2024)
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Fix**: Added `await` to `auth()` call in `src/lib/get-identifier.ts:34`

### 3. No Request Size Limits (FIXED - October 2024)
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Fix**: 10MB limit enforced in middleware with 413 response

### 4. Missing Environment Variable Validation (FIXED - October 2024)
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Fix**: Zod validation for 40+ environment variables in `src/lib/env.ts`

### 5. Supabase SQL Injection Risks (FIXED - October 2024)
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Fix**: Set `search_path = ''` on all SECURITY DEFINER functions (18 functions)

## Security Best Practices

### Current Implementations ‚úÖ
- Clerk/Supabase authentication with role-based access control
- Request size limits (10MB)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure session management
- Input sanitization (`src/lib/input-sanitizer.ts`)
- File type validation for uploads
- Soft delete with 30-day grace period (GDPR Article 17)
- Privacy audit logging with IP truncation

### Recommendations üìã
- Enable database query timeouts
- Implement APM monitoring
- Add automated dependency scanning
- Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) via Vercel/Cloudflare
- Enable DDoS protection
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Add rate limiting to API key usage (OpenAI, Voyage, Pinecone)
- Consider implementing OAuth for third-party integrations
